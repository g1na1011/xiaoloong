          Welcome to Xiao Loong Restaurant, Cuisine of Northern China. We strive
          to bring our guests a culinary experience of traditional cooking by
          families in China. Many dishes and cooking techniques stem from recipes
          passed on from generation to generation and have a history originating
          in Northern and Central China.

          The regions of Sichuan and Beijing are the heart of Xiao Loong's cuisine
          and can be recognized by the different uses of aromatics, spices, and
          cooking styles. Dishes prepared in the Sichuan and Beijing style are
          characterized by spicy and pungent flavors, with an emphasis on strong
          flavored roots and vegetables such as peppers, garlic, and ginger as
          well as a prolific amount of chilis and spicy sauces. You will find
          traditional fare including Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and
          Potstickers, but you will also find innovative items like Prawns with
          Chinese Chive Dumplings, Spicy Chili Prawns, and Xiao Loong Beef.
